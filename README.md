#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
 We use these applications in the technology industry as a human labour alternative to processes that require quick computation, accurate synchronisation, automation and precision control.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
Mastering machine.
The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize ethe xploitation of the limited hardware resources. The first compilers were defined; operating systems were noninteractive. These primitive environments continued evolving up to the definition of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools (CASE tools) facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging. 
Mastering process
The aim during this period was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modelling approach that enables implementation automation. However, for industry, this formal approach was unfeasible due to a lack of tools and training. Furthermore, formal methods became unmanageable for large system development.
Mastering communication
The emergence of the Internet brought with it a new software concept. The decentralization of functions and data led to the rapid development and expansion of areas of computing, such as concurrent programming and distributed architectures, which up to then had been limited to a narrower context. In addition to client/server applications, and in general, any distributed system development, there was now a new engineering software discipline called Web engineering [13]. Moreover, software development was viewed as an industrial process in which quality should be monitored. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall method follows a sequential approach with distinct steps performed in order. This is suitable for projects with well-known requirements, low complexity, predictable outcomes, and a single timeline.
The agile methodology is an  Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Unit testing is a software development process that verifies the functionality of individual software components, or units, by testing isolated source code
Integration Testing - Integration testing is a type of software testing that verifies that multiple parts of a software system work together as expected.
System testing- System testing, also known as end-to-end testing, is a type of software testing that evaluates a fully integrated software system to ensure it meets its requirements:
Acceptance testing-  Acceptance testing is a quality assurance (QA) process that evaluates a software application to ensure it meets the needs of users and business requirements before it's released.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Translate this
Improved prompt-  Translate this from Python to machine code.
